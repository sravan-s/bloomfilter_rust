bloomfilter

Bloom filters are space-efficient probablistic data structures used to test whether an element is a member of a set. We will use this set to create a spellchecker. The source of words are in dictonary.txt. It has ~ 339K words. This is a bloomfilter based spell checker.

P -> Probability of false positives. Constant :- N -> Number of items in the filter You can configure :- M -> Number of bits in the filter. K -> Number of hash functions See -> https://hur.st/bloomfilter for optimzing the bloomfilter
Commands

To build bloomfilter: bloomfilter build path_to_dict_src path_to_dict_output M K To spell check: bloomfilter spell-check path_to_bloom_filter word

For our specific use case -> N = 338782 (dictonary.txt with 338782 words) To achieve a P = 0.01 (1 false positive in 100), Set M=3300300(~400KiB) And K=6

MAX_SIZE of M = 2^64 - 1 MAX_SIZE of K = 2^8 - 1

examples:

`cargo run -- make ~/src/bloomfilter-rs/dictionary.txt ~/src/bloomfilter-rs/bf.bin  3300300 9`

`cargo run -- check ~/src/bloomfilter-rs/bf.bin word`
